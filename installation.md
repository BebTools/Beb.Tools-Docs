# How to Add Beb Tools to Blender

Let’s get Beb Tools into your Blender! Don’t worry, it’s easy-peasy, and I’ll walk you through every step.

## What You’ll Need
- Blender 4.2 (the newest version works best).
- The Beb Tools folder (you can download it from [our website](#) or [GitHub](#)—pick the “Download ZIP” option!).

## Step-by-Step

   - Start Blender 4.2 on your computer.
   - You’ll see the big 3D window with a cube—cool, right?

2. **Find the Add-ons Menu**:
   - Click `Edit` at the top (it’s near `File`).
   - Choose `Preferences` from the list.
   - A new window pops up. Click `Add-ons` on the left side.
