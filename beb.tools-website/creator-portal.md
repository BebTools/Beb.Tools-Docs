## Upload Your Scripts

* Upload Script: Pick one of your scripts, then drag and drop your Blender script file (.py), a description file (.txt), and a picture (.jpg). They need to have the same name—like MyScript.py, MyScript.txt, and MyScript.jpg. Hit “Upload Script,” and it’s live!
* What It Does: Shares your script with other Beb.Tools users so they can download and use it in Blender.
