# GitHub Import

Import scripts and instructions from GitHub.

- **How It Works**:
  - Copy two raw GitHub URLs (`.py` and `.txt`), e.g.:
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BebTools/Beb.Tools-Scripts/main/Create%20Collections%20for%20All%20Empties.py
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BebTools/Beb.Tools-Scripts/main/Create%20Collections%20for%20All%20Empties.txt
    ```
  - Click the paste button (ðŸ“¥) in the Beb.Tools panel.
  - Files download to `/scripts/` with spaces (not `%20`).

- **Notes**:
  - Overwrites existing files with the same name.
  - Supports up to two URLs per paste.
