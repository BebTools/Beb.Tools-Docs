# Making Scripts Work

Let’s make your scripts do their magic!

## Running One Script
1. In Beb Tools, find your script in the list (like “Create Collections for All Empties.py”).
2. Right-click it and pick “Run” (▶).
3. Watch Blender—it might move things, make stuff, or show a message at the bottom!

## Running Lots Together
1. Right-click a script and choose “Queue” (➡️) to add it to your to-do list.
2. Do this for a few scripts you like.
3. Scroll down to the “Queue” section in Beb Tools (click the little arrow if it’s closed).
4. Click “Run All” (▶▶)—Blender does them one by one!

It’s like giving Blender a checklist—how cool is that?
